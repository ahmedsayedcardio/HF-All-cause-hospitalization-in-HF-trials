These files contain the raw data and the R code used to replicate an analysis investigating:
- The ratio of HF to all-cause hospitalization
- Whether HF hospitalization effects can be used as a surrogate for all-cause hospitalization effects
- The % of trials reporting HF hospitalization that report on all-cause hospitalization

If you have any inquiries related to the code or the rationale underlying the statistical analysis, please do not hesitate to contact me (asu.ahmed.sayed@gmail.com).
